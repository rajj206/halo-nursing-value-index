# halo-nursing-value-index
A hackathon project to make nursing contributions visible using AI and the Blueprint’s 9 domains.

# Halo – Nursing Value Index (NVI)
**Tagline:** Making invisible care visible

## 🌍 Problem
Nursing impact is often invisible in hospital metrics, which focus only on absence of harm. Contributions like education, advocacy, and emotional support are unrecognized.

## 💡 Solution
Halo maps nursing activities to the 9 Blueprint domains and creates a **Nursing Value Index (NVI)** — a dashboard showing positive, nurse-sensitive outcomes.

## 🚀 Features
- AI-powered **Domain Mapper** (transcripts → 9 domains)  
- **Outcome Translation Layer** (actions → positive outcomes)  
- **Dashboard Views** (nurse, unit, executive)  
- **Policy Link** (aligns with accreditation & reimbursement)

## 📊 Example
In one shift, a nurse delivered:
- 12 patient education interactions
- 4 advocacy actions
- 3 surveillance interventions

NVI Dashboard: *“This nurse contributed across all 9 domains, preventing risks and improving family education.”*
